****sendScaleScore() and checkSession() in th views.py are the only two viable views.
The second one is the first, and it chcks for d user's sessionID. If there's none it takes dem to the loginpage. sendScaleScore() takes auth user to the scale page and on that page is the endpoint that recieves and saves the name and score (for now). I've marked dem with `#LEGIT USE`

Considering your experience with Mercedes, how likely would you be to recommend Mercedes to your friend or colleague?
