- ## NPS scale
   - Description:
        Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a measure used to gauge customer loyalty, satisfaction, and enthusiasm with a company that’s calculated by asking customers one question: “On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend this product/company to a friend or colleague?”The NPS scale is usually an 11 point rating scale ranging from 0 to 10. 0 is considered as the worst and 10 being the best. However, the scale is not limited to this and can vary from company to company.

- ## LIKERT scale
   - Description: 
        A Likert scale is a rating scale used to measure opinions, attitudes, or behaviors. It consists of a statement or a question, followed by a series of odd numbered answer statements. Respondents choose the option that best corresponds with how they feel about the statement or question. Because respondents are presented with a range of possible answers, Likert scales are great for capturing the level of agreement or their feelings regarding the topic in a more nuanced way.
        Likert scales are most useful when you are measuring unobservable individual characteristics, or characteristics that have no concrete, objective measurement. These can be elements like attitudes, feelings, or opinions that cause variations in behavior.

- ## PERCENT-SUM scale
   - Description: 
        A percent sum scale, also known as a **constant sum scale**, is a type of question used in market research surveys where respondents are required to divide a specific number of points or percents as part of a total sum. The allocation of points is divided to detail the variance and weight of each category. Is there anything else you would like to know about this topic?

- ## STAPEL scale
   - Description: 
        A Stapel Scale is a unipolar (one adjective) rating scale designed to measure the respondent’s attitude towards an object or event. The scale is comprised of even number categories ranging from negative to positive without any neutral point (zero). The Stapel Scale is usually displayed with a single adjective in the middle of the number list and measures the extent of agreement or disagreement with an object. A higher positive range depicts acceptance, while a negative range is the exact opposite2

- ## RANKING Scale
   - Description:
        A ranking scale is a survey question tool that measures people's preferences by asking them to rank their views on a list of related items. The ranking scale is used for managing ranking scales and collecting user responses. It provides endpoints for creating new ranking scales and submitting rankings for a specific scale. The API allows users to define ranking scales with multiple stages and sub-stages, and users can submit their rankings for each stage. The API facilitates the storage and retrieval of ranking data, enabling analysis and insights based on user-generated rankings.

- ## QSORT scale

    - Description: The Q-Sort Scale is a psychological assessment tool used to measure and rank subjective opinions or personality traits of individuals. It typically involves sorting a set of items or statements into predefined categories, allowing researchers to gain insights into an individual's perceptions, values, or preferences. Given below is the API collection for creating and managing Q-Sort scales, streamlining the process of administering and analyzing Q-Sort assessments.

- ## Paired-Comparison scale
   - Description:
         A paired comparison scale is a type of measurement scale that compares two items at a time and asks respondents to choose which item they prefer. It is a comparative scale, meaning that it measures the relative differences between items, rather than the absolute value of each item. Paired comparison scales are often used in market research to measure consumer preferences for different products, brands, or features. The API provides endpoints for defining items to be compared, attach images and submit ressponses. This data can then be retrieved and analysed for insight gathering.

- ## Perceptual Mapping Scale
   - Description: 
      A perceptual mapping scale is a type of scale that is used to measure how consumers perceive different products, brands, or services. It is a graphical representation of consumers' perceptions, and it can be used to identify opportunities for new products or services, to develop marketing strategies, and to track changes in consumer perceptions over time. The API provides endpoints for defining products to be rated and the graphical limits, then endpoints to give ratings to products within the specified graohical limits are provided. Perceptual mapping scales are a valuable tool for businesses that want to understand how consumers perceive their products or services. They can be used to make more informed decisions about product development, marketing, and brand positioning.
